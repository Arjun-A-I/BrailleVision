# Technohack-Team-Sentinal
This project aims to improve the daily lives of audio-visually impaired individuals by creating a navigation and interaction system that uses object recognition technology and dynamic braille to identify objects in their environment. Additionally, the system enables the user to find objects using ASL and guides them towards the object. 

# What are the specific problems you are planning to solve with this idea? <br/>
● Audio-Visually impaired people are always dependent on others in their daily
routine.<br/>
● They find it difficult to understand about an object.<br/>
● Unable to interact with a person who doesn't have any knowledge regarding sign
language.<br/>
● Audio-Visually-impaired individuals find it difficult to find things(objects) of their
need .<br/>
● They are unable to explore the world, while following the warnings,signals,etc.<br/>
● Find difficult to use the public transport system.<br/>


 # What are the solutions you plan to implement to solve the above mentioned problem?<br/>
● The interaction between the computer vision and the individual is achieved using
a dynamic braille.<br/>
● This device helps in interacting with the surrounding objects and makes their task
easier.(using multiple machine learning models).<br/>
● This device helps in finding the required object from the surrounding using ASL
communication and the hardware leads them to the object.<br/>
● This device can recognize characters in the real world and transfer them to the
individual.<br/>
● Converts speech to braille (communicating between normal person)<br/>
● Has a screen which can be edited by the individual using sign language which
helps in interacting with the public.<br/>
